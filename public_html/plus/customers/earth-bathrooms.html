  <p><h2>Opting for online</h2>

<p>Selling online has worked really well for us but the challenge with
bathroom fixtures is that it’s still a tangible product; people still
want to feel the quality of the materials, understand the size and
shape of the baths, or understand how compatible the products are with
each other. There are a lot of technical challenges to overcome and
the only way to combat that is with really good technical content and
an exceptional customer service team - those are two things that we do
really, really well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By using Shopify we were present in the market after only two and a
half months</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Speed with Shopify</h2>

<p>The reason we chose Shopify over any other platform was the speed at
which it allowed us to build our business. We started planning in
October 2014 and we launched the brand in the middle of December 2014.
Shopify had the functionality to facilitate what we
needed to prepare to launch and test the market, so all we had to do
was design and build a template in liquid.</p>

<p>Had we invested in building something from scratch it would have

</blockquote>

<h2>Complete flexibility</h2>

<p>Because Shopify has such a well-documented, robust and well-exposed
API, it meant that we had absolute confidence in building our own
middleware to sit between Shopify and our supplier system. The API
allows us to get around a lot of the limitations of the system, so
we’ve never been restricted by what Shopify can and can’t do.</p>

<h2>Affordable functionality</h2>

<p>One thing that’s really added value for us is Shopify’s ecosystem of
apps which allows you to launch a great piece of functionality very
quickly, no matter the size or age of your business. One of the
challenges we face is tracking returns, but we found a solution
through one of Shopify’s app developers. The returns monitor app
costed us around $20-30 to buy, meaning we were able to build in that
functionality ourselves cost effectively. Had we invested in building
something from scratch, it would have taken about nine and a half years
for it to become financially viable. For a new business like
ourselves, that kind of affordability is key to accelerating your
growth and success.</p>
